Hey Dennis,

I was wondering if you'd be interested in participating in a panel discussion at the Cloud Summit.

A friend of mine, who is a co-organizer of the Cloud Summit, is putting together a panel focused on Cloud and AI.

The Cloud Summit is a significant event â€“ I believe they had around 700 attendees last year (though don't quote me on that! :P). It's also sponsored by some major players, which could provide Unblocked with good visibility. Plus, I'm confident you'd bring a lot of valuable insights to the event. It's a win-win!

Please let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. The event is scheduled for May 27th."""
